JONGOL Poultry Incubation Initiative (JPP)

A practical, community-led project helping rural families earn more and improve food security through reliable chick production, farmer training, and market access.

The Challenge

For many smallholder households, poultry is one of the fastest and most affordable ways to generate income. But traditional hatching methods often lead to:
	•	low hatch rates
	•	high chick mortality
	•	limited access to training and animal health guidance
	•	inconsistent markets and poor pricing

This keeps flock sizes small and profits unpredictable.

Our Solution

The JONGOL Poultry Incubation Initiative (JPP) strengthens poultry production by combining:
	•	incubation support (reliable hatching capacity)
	•	brooding support (stronger chick survival)
	•	farmer training (housing, feeding, hygiene, disease prevention)
	•	market linkages (helping farmers sell chicks, growers, eggs, and mature birds)

JPP is designed to start strong at a manageable scale, then expand as the model becomes self-sustaining through reinvestment.

What We Do

1) Incubation & Brooding

We run structured hatch cycles, following clear hygiene and quality procedures (egg selection, candling, cleaning, temperature control). Chicks are then supported through proper brooding practices to reduce early losses.

2) Farmer Training

We train participating households in practical, everyday skills:
	•	improved housing and predator control
	•	feeding and clean water routines
	•	brooding techniques and temperature management
	•	hygiene and biosecurity basics
	•	record keeping (costs, mortality, sales)
	•	simple marketing and group-selling strategies

3) Distribution & Follow-Up Support

Farmers access chicks through an agreed community model (e.g., subsidised pricing, revolving approach, or group support). We follow up with guidance visits and peer learning to help farmers apply what they learn.

4) Livelihood & Market Growth

As farmers grow their flocks, we support connections to local buyers and encourage collective selling for better pricing and consistent demand.

Who This Helps

JPP prioritises:
	•	women-led households
	•	youth (18–35) building livelihoods
	•	low-income smallholder farmers ready to participate and learn

The project strengthens both income and nutrition, supporting families to become more resilient over time.

⸻

What Success Looks Like

We track measurable progress through:
	•	hatch rate and chick survival rate
	•	number of households trained and supported
	•	flock size growth at household level
	•	income generated through sales (chicks, eggs, birds)
	•	lessons learned to improve each cycle

Over time, JPP aims to grow into a stable community enterprise that can reach more households and villages.
