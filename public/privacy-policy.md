# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 22 February 2026



## Before we get into the details …

If you are wondering what happens to your group’s data when you use Habuks, the answer is simple:

We store it securely.
We use it only to provide the service to you.
We do not sell it.
We do not publish it.
We do not share it with anyone unexpected.

Your group’s financial records belong to your group.

If you would like the full explanation, please continue reading.


## Who We Are

Habuks (“Habuks”, “we”, “us”, “our”) provides a web-based platform that enables community groups to manage contributions, income-generating activities (IGAs), expenses, payouts, projects, and member records.

This Privacy Policy applies to visitors and users of our website, platform, and related services (together, the “Service”).

This policy explains:

* What personal data we collect
* How we use it
* When we share it
* How long we keep it
* Your rights regarding your data

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or how we process personal data, you can contact us using the details at the end of this document.



## Children

Habuks is intended for use by community groups and their adult members.

The Service is not directed to children under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age required under applicable law to consent to data processing).

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child without valid consent where required, we will delete that information as soon as reasonably possible.

# 1. The Personal Data We Process

## 1.1 Information You Provide Directly

When you create an account or use the Service, we may collect:

* Name

* Group name and description
* Member role within a group (e.g., Chairperson, Treasurer, Member)
* Financial records entered into the system (contributions, expenses, payouts, project records)

We collect this information to provide and operate the Service.

If you do not provide certain required information, some features of the Service may not function properly.

If you upload or enter personal data about other individuals (such as group members), you are responsible for ensuring that you have the authority to provide that data and that those individuals are informed appropriately where required by law.

## 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

When you access or use Habuks, we automatically collect certain technical information, including:

* IP address
* Device type and browser type
* Operating system
* Log data (date, time, and duration of access)
* Pages visited and actions performed
* Cookies and similar technologies

We use this information to ensure platform security, improve performance, analyze usage trends, and prevent misuse.



## 1.3 Information from Third Parties

We may receive limited information from third-party providers such as:

* Authentication providers
* Hosting and infrastructure providers
* Analytics services
* Payment processors (if payments are processed through the Service)

Where payments are processed through third-party providers, we do not store full credit or debit card details.

# 2. How We Use Personal Data

We use personal data to:

* Provide and maintain the Habuks platform
* Enable financial tracking and reporting
* Send notifications and reminders
* Provide customer support
* Improve and develop new features
* Monitor performance and usage
* Detect and prevent fraud or unauthorized access
* Comply with legal obligations

We do not sell personal data.

We do not use your group’s financial records for advertising purposes.



# 3. Legal Basis for Processing (EEA Users)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), we process personal data under the following legal bases:

* Performance of a contract (to provide the Service)
* Legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, service improvement)
* Compliance with legal obligations
* Consent (where required, such as for marketing communications or certain cookies)


# 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share personal data only in limited circumstances:

* With service providers who assist in operating the Service (e.g., hosting, analytics, email delivery)
* With payment processors (if applicable)
* When required by law or legal process
* In connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset transfer

All third-party service providers are required to safeguard personal data appropriately.

We do not sell or rent personal data to third parties.

# 5. Role of Group Administrators

Habuks enables group administrators to manage member records and financial data.

In most cases:

* Group administrators determine what member data is entered into the system.
* Habuks acts as a data processor for group-level financial and member records.
* The group may act as the data controller for its members’ personal data.

Legal counsel should confirm the formal classification of these roles under applicable law.



# 6. Data Retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary to:

* Provide the Service
* Fulfill contractual obligations
* Comply with legal requirements
* Resolve disputes
* Enforce agreements

When a group account is deleted, associated personal data will be deleted or anonymized within a reasonable period, unless we are legally required to retain it longer.


# 7. Data Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, including:

* Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS)
* Secure authentication mechanisms
* Role-based access controls
* Restricted internal access to production systems

While we take appropriate steps to protect personal data, no system can guarantee absolute security.



# 8. International Data Transfers

If personal data is transferred outside the European Economic Area, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as contractual protections or equivalent legal mechanisms required by applicable law.



# 9. Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

* Access your personal data
* Correct inaccurate data
* Request deletion
* Restrict processing
* Object to processing
* Request data portability
* Withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent)

Requests may be submitted to: [Insert Contact Email]

We may request identity verification before responding.



# 10. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies and similar technologies to:

* Maintain secure sessions
* Improve platform performance
* Understand how users interact with the Service

Users can manage cookie preferences through browser settings. Some features of the Service may not function properly if essential cookies are disabled.

# 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect:

* Changes to our services or features
* Updates to applicable laws or regulations
* Improvements in how we handle personal data
* Clarifications to improve transparency

When changes are made, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.

If a change is minor (for example, clarification of wording), we may update this page without additional notice.

If a change materially affects how we process personal data — such as introducing new categories of data collection, new purposes of processing, new types of data sharing, or changes to user rights — we will take reasonable steps to notify users before the changes take effect. This may include:

* Displaying a notice within the platform
* Sending an email notification
* Requesting renewed consent where legally required

Continued use of the Service after the updated Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes acknowledgment of the updated terms, unless applicable law requires explicit consent.

If you do not agree with the updated Privacy Policy, you may stop using the Service and request deletion of your account, subject to applicable legal retention requirements.

We encourage users to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
