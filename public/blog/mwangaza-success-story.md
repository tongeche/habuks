# How Mwangaza Group Transformed Their Financial Management

When Mary Wanjiru first joined Mwangaza Investment Group in 2023, the group was struggling with inconsistent contributions and a lack of transparency in their financial records.

## The Challenge

Like many community savings groups across Kenya, Mwangaza faced common challenges:

- Manual record-keeping that led to errors
- Difficulty tracking who had paid and who hadn't
- No clear visibility into the group's total savings
- Time-consuming monthly reconciliation meetings

> "We spent more time arguing about records than actually planning for our future," recalls Mary.

## Finding Habuks

A friend recommended Habuks to the group's treasurer, and after a quick demo, the team decided to give it a try.

### The Onboarding Process

Getting started was surprisingly simple:

1. The treasurer created a group account
2. Members were invited via SMS
3. The group's existing records were migrated
4. Training took just one afternoon

## The Results

After six months of using Habuks, Mwangaza saw remarkable improvements:

- **40% increase in savings** due to automated reminders
- **100% contribution compliance** for three consecutive months
- **Zero disputes** about financial records
- **50% reduction** in meeting time

## What Members Say

The impact on individual members has been equally impressive. James Ochieng, one of the founding members, shares:

> "I can now check my contribution history anytime on my phone. There's no more waiting for the treasurer to share updates."

## Looking Forward

Today, Mwangaza is planning their first group investment—a small piece of land in Kiambu County. With clear financial records and strong member trust, they're confident about their future.
