# Introducing the New Project Management Module

We're excited to announce the launch of our most requested feature: the **Project Management Module**. This powerful addition to Habuks helps community groups plan, execute, and track their projects with unprecedented clarity.

## Why We Built This

Community groups don't just save money—they invest it. Whether it's buying land, starting a business, or funding community initiatives, groups need tools to manage these projects effectively.

Based on feedback from over 500 groups, we identified the key pain points:

- Difficulty tracking project milestones
- Unclear task assignments
- Budget overruns due to poor visibility
- Communication gaps between members

The Project Management Module addresses all of these challenges.

## Key Features

### 1. Project Dashboard

Get a bird's eye view of all your group's projects:

- Active vs. completed projects
- Budget utilization
- Upcoming deadlines
- Recent activity

### 2. Milestone Tracking

Break down projects into manageable milestones:

- Set target dates
- Track completion status
- Add notes and updates
- Attach relevant documents

### 3. Task Assignment

Assign responsibilities to members:

- Create tasks within milestones
- Set due dates
- Send automatic reminders
- Track completion

> "Finally, we know exactly who is responsible for what. No more confusion!" — Beta tester feedback

### 4. Budget Management

Keep finances on track:

- Set project budgets
- Track expenses in real-time
