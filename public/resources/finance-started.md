# Financial Records Best Practices Guide

This guide explains how to properly record income and expenses using **Finance & Records** in Habuks.

This is operational guidance only. Your organization remains responsible for financial oversight and compliance.

# 1. Understanding Record Types

When you click **+ Add record**, you will choose a **Record type**:

* Contribution
* Expense
* Payout
* Welfare inflow

Choose carefully. The record type affects how totals and reports are calculated.

Do not use “Expense” for money received. Do not use “Contribution” for money paid out.

Incorrect types distort your Net Balance.

# 2. Recording Contributions (Income)

To record income:

1. Go to **Finance & Records**
2. Click **+ Add record**
3. Select **Contribution**
4. Set the correct **Status**
5. Enter details and save

### What to Enter

* Record name (e.g., “Agnes Otieno February Contribution”)
* Date received
* Amount (KES)
* Project (if applicable)
* Optional note
* Attachment (recommended)

### Choosing Status Correctly

Use:

* **Received** if money is already in hand
* **Pending** if payment is expected but not yet received
* **Approved** only if your governance process requires it

Do not mark income as “Received” if you have not confirmed it.

# 3. Recording Expenses

To record expenses:

1. Click **+ Add record**
2. Select **Expense**
3. Enter details

### Required Information

* Clear record name (e.g., “Office stationery – Feb”)
* Date paid
* Exact amount
* Linked project (if relevant)
* Supporting receipt (upload in Attachment)

Avoid vague descriptions like “miscellaneous.”

If possible, upload receipts immediately. Delayed documentation leads to disputes.

---

# 4. Using Status Properly

Your system includes these statuses:

* Pending
* Paid
* Posted
* Approved
* Received
* Scheduled

Use them consistently.

Example workflow for expenses:

1. Pending – Expense recorded but not yet paid
2. Approved – Leadership approved it
3. Paid – Money has left your account

Do not skip steps if your group requires approval.

Status misuse is a common source of reporting errors.

---

# 5. Attachments Matter

Always upload supporting documents when possible:

* Receipts
* Invoices
* Bank statements
* Payment confirmations

Habuks stores what you upload. It does not validate authenticity.

Attachments protect both the Treasurer and the organization.

---

# 6. Reconciliation (Critical Step)

Your dashboard shows:

* Total inflow
* Total outflow
* Net balance
* Pending items

At least once per month:

1. Compare Net Balance with your bank statement.
2. Count physical cash and compare totals.
3. Review Pending items.
4. Confirm no missing records.

If numbers do not match, investigate immediately.

Never carry unexplained differences into the next month.

---

# 7. Separation of Duties

For stronger governance:

* One person records transactions.
* Another reviews or approves.
* Leadership receives monthly reports.
* Do not share login credentials.

If one person records, approves, and controls funds, risk increases.

Software cannot prevent internal misuse without structure.

---

# 8. Monthly Closing Checklist

At the end of each month:

* Review all Contributions
* Review all Expenses
* Confirm attachments are uploaded
* Reconcile balances
* Clear outdated Pending items
* Export reports from **Reports**
* Share summary with leadership

Consistency builds transparency.

# 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Editing past transactions without documentation
* Backdating entries without explanation
* Leaving transactions permanently in “Pending”
* Recording bulk totals instead of individual contributions
* Using personal bank accounts without proper tracking

Habuks records exactly what users enter. Accuracy depends on your process.
