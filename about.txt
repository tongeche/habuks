About Us — JONGOL Self Help Group

JONGOL is a community-led self help group built by ordinary people who are tired of watching hard work lead to the same struggle year after year.

We come from households where a single unexpected cost—a hospital visit, a failed harvest, school fees—can quietly undo months of effort. In places like ours, people don’t lack ambition. We lack steady opportunity, reliable systems, and the kind of support that turns small effort into lasting progress.

So we organised ourselves.

Who We Are

JONGOL is a local group of members who pool time, skills, and resources to build practical solutions for livelihoods and family wellbeing. We believe that dignity grows when people can earn, plan, and provide—without having to depend on luck or emergency help.

We work closely with community members, listen first, and design projects that are simple, honest, and realistic—projects that can survive beyond the excitement of the launch.

What We Stand For

We stand for dignity over dependency.
We do not exist to “save” anyone. We exist to make it easier for families to stand on their feet and stay there.

We stand for practical change.
We focus on solutions that meet daily life: income, food security, skills, and community support.

We stand for trust and accountability.
We keep clear records, track results, and share what we learn—because every donor, volunteer, and member deserves transparency.

We stand for community leadership.
The people most affected by the challenges are the ones leading the solutions. Support should strengthen local ownership—not replace it.

Why We Do This Work

Because we have seen what happens when people are left alone with problems that are bigger than them.

We have seen youth give up on meaningful work because nothing reliable comes after effort.
We have seen women carry entire households with little support.
We have seen families with skills and discipline still lose progress because the system around them is fragile.

And we have also seen what happens when a community gets organised: people become confident, problems become manageable, and small wins turn into real stability.

How We Work

We build projects around three principles:
	1.	Start small, do it well — prove the model before expanding.
	2.	Train and support — skills, follow-up, and peer learning matter as much as equipment.
	3.	Reinvest and grow — projects should become stronger over time, not remain dependent.

Where Volunteers and Donors Fit In

If you’re a volunteer, you’re not here to “fix” us—you’re here to walk with us, strengthen systems, share skills, and help us document and learn. You help good ideas become organised, measurable, and scalable.

If you’re a donor, your support becomes more than a donation. It becomes:
	•	tools that create income,
	•	training that reduces losses,
	•	follow-up that ensures success,
	•	and accountability that protects every shilling.

You help us move from survival to stability—household by household.

Our Commitment to You

We will be honest about what’s working and what’s not.
We will share progress, results, and lessons learned.
We will protect the dignity of our members and the communities we serve.
And we will keep building—carefully, transparently, and with purpose.
